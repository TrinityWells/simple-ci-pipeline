#  Simple CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a **basic Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline** using **GitHub Actions**.  
The workflow automatically installs dependencies and runs tests every time code is pushed to the 'main' branch.

---

##  Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Learn the basics of **CI/CD**
- Automate testing of your code
- Ensure that your project builds correctly every time
- Understand how **GitHub Actions workflows** work

---

## Technologies Used

- **GitHub Actions**
- **Node.js**
- **npm**
- **YAML**

---

##  How the Pipeline Works

1. You push code to the **main** branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers the workflow
3. The workflow:
   - Checks out the repository code
   - Sets up Node.js
   - Installs project dependencies
   - Runs automated tests
